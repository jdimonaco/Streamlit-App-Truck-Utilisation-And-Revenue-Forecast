# Task Explanation
This project aims to analyse daily truck utilisation and predict revenue using Python. The implementation uses pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and Streamlit for web app deployment. The project seeks to automate the calculation of truck utilisation, reducing manual input, and to forecast revenue. The aim is to optimise operations, reduce costs, and enhance financial forecasting for better planning and decision-making, ultimately improving overall efficiency.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture involves the following steps:

## Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values 
Remove duplicate records

## Testing: 

Test the values before and after data preprocessing

## Model Training:

Calculate truck utilisation
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train the logistic regression model on the training set

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error
Visualise the difference between the model's predictions and actual values


A Streamlit app is provided to interact with the model. This app allows users to:

Upload their own dataset
Preprocess the data
Train the model
Make predictions
Visualise results

## Data
This project and dataset were created specifically for educational purpose. The data is fictional and may not reflect the full complexity of real-world scenarios.
